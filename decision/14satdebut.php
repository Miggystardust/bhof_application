              RSVPs before we can notify some other applicants, so please RSVP 
              RIGHT AWAY (no later than March 18th, 2014, and preferably sooner because we can't announce the lineup until we've gotten all the RSVPs). And please RSVP to 
              us before you post about it online :)</strong></font></p>

              the full lineup. We'll send you a press release you can send to your local media outlets. And we will put you in touch with the Saturday 
              Night show producers. We will provide them with the tech info that 
              your application contained. They will be in touch with you to work 
              out final tech requirements, schedule walk-throughs, collect music, 
              etc. <strong>Remember that your act must be under the 4-minute time 
            limit, so be sure to work on trimming it if necessary!</strong></font></p>
