              your application, and we&#8217;ve got some good news for you! Your 
              act was among the best of all applicants and thus we would like 
              to offer you a guaranteed spot to perform your act in a noncompetitive 
              capacity in the <strong>Thursday Night Showcase</strong> on Thursday 
              May 30st, 2013. <strong>There&#8217;s further good news:</strong> 
              your act is being offered a spot as an alternate for the Saturday June 1st competition in the event 
              of any cancellations... which does happen!!!</font></p>
            <p><font color="781428">We&#8217;d also like to congratulate you on 
              being what we consider to be an innovator in the world of modern 
              burlesque. We&#8217;re really promoting the Thursday night show 
              as being a showcase of innovative, must-see acts. A spot in the 
              Thursday show means that the Selection Team felt your act was innovative, 
              brilliant, edgy, daring, or all of the above, and felt that the 
              BHOF Weekend attendees should see it.</font></p>
            <p><font color="781428"><strong>What does this mean?</strong><br>
              If you accept this invitation, you must perform the act that you 
              have submitted-- you cannot perform a different act instead. And 
              be ready to potentially perform it in the Saturday competition! 
              If you are a female soloist, then in future years, you are eligible 
              to apply in the main &#8220;Miss Exotic World&#8221; category.</font> </p>
            <p><font color="781428"> We will contact you if a spot in the competition opens up for you. </font></p>
            <p><font color="781428">If you do not wish to perform on Thursday, 
              you can decline; but in future years, you will still be considered 
              a &#8220;Debut&#8221; contestant. (Unless you have previously performed 
              at the BHOF Weekend in the past.)</font></p>
            <p><font color="781428"><br>

              Night show producers. We will provide them with the tech info that

              out final tech requirements, schedule run-throughs, collect music, 
              etc.</font></p>
            <p><font color="781428">Also, we'll put you in touch with the program 
              designer, so that you can provide them with your full info and a 
              high-resolution photo.</font></p>
            <p><font color="781428">Thank you again for applying! We appreciate
