              available-- and so we&#8217;ve had to turn down some truly 
              exceptional acts.</font>)</p>

              wanted, we would like to thank you VERY MUCH for your support! And 
              we hope to still see you in June and that this news doesn&#8217;t 
              keep you from applying in the future. (And you can still get discounted weekend passes until March 31st as a way of reiterating our 
              thanks.)</font></p>
