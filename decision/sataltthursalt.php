              your application, and while we unfortunately can&#8217;t offer your 
              act a spot at this time, we&#8217;d like you to know that the Selection 
              Team scored your act highly enough that we would like to offer you 
              a spot on the alternate list. In fact-- your act was considered particularly
              &quot;innovative&quot; so it's on the alternate list for both the 
              Thursday &quot;Movers, Shakers, &amp; Innovators&quot; show as well 
              as the Saturday competition! (We have a few other people who are 
              on the list for one or the other. But you're on the list for both, 
              which is very unusual and speaks well to your talent.)</font></p>
            <p><font color="781428">Even though it's not an offer for a spot yet, 
              this means that your act was among the top ~15% of all the ones 
              submitted, and you should congratulate yourself on a job well done! 
              We can't tell you where you are on the alternate list, but there 
              aren't too many names on it, so we'll be in touch with you in the 
              event of any cancellations that would open up a spot for you. </font></p>
            <p><font color="781428">We realize that it's tough to make travel 
              plans without knowing this. So we hope you'll consider coming anyway. 
              To make this easier for people on the alternate list, we are still offering discounted presale tickets to applicants. </font></p>

              let us know your performer name and &quot;Yes, I'd like to remain
