              your application, and we would like to offer you the opportunity 
              to perform your act in the <strong>Thursday Night Movers, Shakers, 
              &amp; Innovators </strong>showcase on Thursday June 5, 2014. </font></p>
            <p><font color="781428">As with previous years, we've cast the Thursday night show to be a 
              showcase of innovative, must-see acts. A spot in the Thursday show 
              means that the evaluation team felt your act especially was innovative, 
              brilliant, edgy, daring, or all of the above, and felt that the 
              BHOF Weekend attendees should see it!</font></p>
            <p><font color="781428"><strong>What does this mean?</strong><br>
              If you accept this invitation, you must perform the act that you 
              have submitted-- you cannot perform a different act instead.</font></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><font color="781428">If you're a female soloist: in future years, 
              you are eligible to apply in the main &#8220;Miss Exotic World&#8221; 
              category! </font><font color="781428">If you do not wish to perform 
              on Thursday, you can decline; but this means that in future years, you should still 
              apply in the &#8220;Debut&#8221; category. (Unless you have previously 
              performed at the BHOF Weekend in the past.)</font></p>
            <p><font color="781428"><br>
              <strong>Here's what to do next:</strong></font></p>
            <p><strong><font color="781428">Please send us a quick email at 2014@bhofapplication.com 
              with the subject line &#8220;Thursday night RSVP.&#8221; In the 
              email, let us know your performer name and &quot;Yes, I'm in for 
              the Thursday Night Showcase!&quot; or &quot;Sorry, I decline.&quot; 
              Please RSVP to us by March 18th, 2014... or preferably even sooner so that we can publish the lineup. And please RSVP before you 
              post about it online. :)</font></strong></p>
            <p><strong><font color="781428">What happens after that:</font></strong></p>
            <p><font color="781428">Once we have all the RSVPs, we will announce 
              the full lineup. We'll send you a press release you can send to your local media outlets. And we will put you in touch with the Thursday 
              Night show producers. We will provide them with the tech info that 
              your application contained. They will be in touch with you to work 
              out final tech requirements, schedule walk-throughs, collect music, 
              etc. <strong>Remember that your act must still be under the time 
            limit, so be sure to work on trimming it if necessary!</strong></font></p>
            <p><font color="781428">We will also be contacting you with instructions on how to submit a high-resolution photo for the souvenir program; please have this ready so as not to delay the printing process.</font></p>
            <p><font color="781428">Thank you again for applying! We appreciate 
              your support and would love to hear feedback about the online application 
              process, just email us at 2014@bhofapplication.com with any feedback 
              (positive or negative). We'll see you in June!</font> And don't forget to RSVP to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1492695344291240" target="_blank">2014 BHOF Weekend Facebook event</a>!</p>
