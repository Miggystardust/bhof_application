              your application, and while we unfortunately can&#8217;t offer your 
              act a spot at this time, we&#8217;d like you to know that the Selection 
              Team found your act significantly noteworthy that we would like 
              to offer you a spot as an<strong> alternate for the Thursday Night 
              Movers, Shakers, and Innovators showcase on Thursday, June 5, 2014</strong>.</font></p>
            <p><font color="781428">We&#8217;d also like to congratulate you on 
              being what we consider to be an innovator in the world of modern 
              burlesque. The Thursday night show has become known for  being a showcase of innovative, must-see acts. So this means 
              that the evaluation team felt your act was innovative, brilliant, 
              edgy, daring, or all of the above.</font></p>
            <p><font color="781428">We realize that it's tough to make travel 
              plans without knowing this. So we hope you'll consider coming anyway. 
              To make this easier for people on the alternate list, we are still offering discounted presale tickets until March 31st.</font></p>
            <p><font color="781428"><strong>What does this mean?</strong><br>
              At the moment, there is not a performance spot for you in the Weekend-- 
              but the alternate list is short and we will let you know if 
              a spot opens up. </font></p>
            <p><font color="781428">If a spot does open up for you on Thursday, 
              you must perform the act that you have submitted-- you cannot perform 
              a different act instead. And if you&#8217;re a female soloist, then 
              if you do end up performing this year, then you are eligible to 
              apply in the main Miss Exotic World category in the future!</font></p>

              <strong>Here's what to do next:</strong></font></p>

              let us know your performer name and if you would like to remain 
              on the alternate list. (In other words, if you know you can&#8217;t 
              come-- please let us know.) RSVPs must be received by March 18th, 
              2014--and please RSVP before you post about it online :)</font></strong></p>
